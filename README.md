This is the first repo I've ever made so if you all start doing reqeusts/pulls etc and really want to contribute you'll have to be patient with me.

Instructions:
Install Tampermonkey browser extension https://www.tampermonkey.net/
In Chrome: you need to enable developer options for it to work in your extensions settings

Once you've enabled Developer options you can then add the user script https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/513318-fix-memeflags
